# UniMaster - University Mangement System

UniMaster is a university management system developed as part of a Database Management Systems course. This project uses React, MySQL, and Tailwind CSS to create a platform for managing university operations.

### Frontend
The frontend is built using React (initialized with Vite) and styled with Tailwind CSS.

### Backend
The backend is powered by Node.js and MySQL, providing a robust server-side infrastructure.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- MySQL

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
